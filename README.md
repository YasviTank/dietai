# Diet AI

An LLM which can assess the eating habits and ailments of the user, and suggest healthy foods which aid them in making their health better, based on the user's preferred cuisine.

## Project Vision & Status

This project is being initiated for a hackathon. The core development and features will be built collaboratively by the contributors. We welcome your expertise and effort in bringing Diet AI to life!

**Current Non-Commercial Focus:** This project is licensed under the permissive MIT License (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)), which allows for a wide range of uses, including commercial ones. However, for the duration and immediate purpose of this hackathon, Diet AI is intended as an open-source, non-commercial project. Any future considerations for commercialization would be a separate discussion among the project maintainers and contributors.

## Project Details

-   **Project Title:** Diet AI
-   **Project Mission:** To empower users to make informed dietary choices and improve their well-being through personalized, AI-driven food recommendations.
-   **Project Description:** Diet AI aims to be an intelligent assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand a user's dietary patterns, health concerns, and culinary preferences. Based on this, it will provide tailored suggestions for healthy food options, complete with recipes and nutritional information, helping users achieve their health goals.
-   **Core Functionality (To be developed):**
    *   User profile creation (dietary restrictions, preferences, health goals).
    *   Natural language interaction for diet assessment.
    *   Personalized meal and food suggestions.
    *   Recipe generation/retrieval.
    *   Nutritional information display.
-   **Project Difficulty:** High (Requires innovative application of AI/ML techniques and robust backend development)
-   **Target Contributors:** We are looking for 1-2 enthusiastic developers with a passion for AI, health tech, and collaborative problem-solving.
-   **Skills Required:**
    *   **AI/ML:** Experience with LLMs, natural language processing (NLP), recommendation systems.
    *   **Programming:** Proficiency in Python (common for AI/ML) or other relevant backend languages. Familiarity with API development.
    *   **(Optional but valued):** Frontend development skills for a potential user interface, database management.
-   **Expected Outcomes & Deliverables:**
    *   A functional backend API for core Diet AI services.
    *   A curated dataset or knowledge base for food items, recipes, and nutritional data (or integration with existing APIs).
    *   Clear documentation for API usage and system architecture.
    *   (Stretch Goal) A simple prototype UI to demonstrate core features.
-   **Additional Resources or References:** (To be added by the team as research progresses)
